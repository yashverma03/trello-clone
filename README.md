## Description

- Build a kanban board that fetches data from an API & display the ticket cards based on grouping and ordering settings. 
- Cards can be grouped in 3 ways (by status, by user and by priority) and sorted in 2 ways (by priority and by title).
- All the settings in display modal is stored in local storage & hence the settings are saved even when the user reloads the page.
- Some icons such as user icon, icon in front of title and icon in front of tag are conditionally rendered depending upon which grouping mode is selected.
- The design has been made responsive and the number of columns depends upon the width of the screen.
- Airbnb style guide has been used for linting.
- Tech: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and ReactJS.
